The String of Pearls (Senecio rowleyanus) is a stunning, trailing succulent known for its unique, bead-like leaves. With proper care, this plant can thrive and add elegance to any indoor or outdoor space. Follow this guide to keep your String of Pearls healthy and beautiful.

## 1. **Lighting Requirements**

- **Indoors**: Place in a spot with bright, indirect light, such as near a south-facing window.
- **Outdoors**: Provide partial shade to avoid sunburn, especially during intense midday sun.
- **Grow Lights**: If natural light is insufficient, use a grow light to supplement.

### Tip:
Signs of insufficient light include sparse or elongated pearls. Move your plant to a brighter spot if needed.

## 2. **Watering Tips**

String of Pearls is sensitive to overwatering, so proper watering is crucial.

- **Frequency**: Water only when the soil is completely dry. This may be every 2-3 weeks, depending on your environment.
- **Method**: Use the "soak and dry" techniqueâ€”water thoroughly until it drains, then let the soil dry completely before watering again.
- **Winter Care**: Reduce watering frequency during the plantâ€™s dormant period.

### Warning:
Overwatering can lead to root rot. Check for mushy stems or discolored pearls as signs of overwatering.

---

## 3. **Soil and Pot Requirements**

- **Soil**: Use a well-draining succulent or cactus mix. You can create your own mix by combining:
  - 2 parts potting soil
  - 1 part sand or perlite
- **Pot**: Choose a container with drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the bottom.

---

## 4. **Temperature and Humidity**

- **Temperature**: String of Pearls prefers temperatures between 60-80Â°F (15-27Â°C).
- **Humidity**: Thrives in low to moderate humidity. Avoid placing it in high-humidity areas like bathrooms.

### Note:
Protect your plant from frost by moving it indoors during colder months.

## 5. **Fertilization**

Feed your String of Pearls sparingly to encourage growth:

- **Type**: Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength.
- **Frequency**: Fertilize once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).
- **Avoid**: Do not fertilize during the plantâ€™s dormant period (fall and winter).

---

## 6. **Pruning and Propagation**

- **Pruning**: Trim leggy or damaged stems to maintain a compact shape.
- **Propagation**: Propagating String of Pearls is easy:
  - Cut a healthy stem, 4-6 inches long.
  - Let the cut end dry for a day or two.
  - Place the stem on moist soil, ensuring the pearls make contact with the soil.
  - Water lightly and keep in bright, indirect light.

## 7. **Common Problems and Solutions**

- **Pests**: Watch for mealybugs or spider mites. Remove them with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol.
- **Overwatering**: If pearls become mushy or fall off, reduce watering and check for root rot.
- **Underwatering**: Shriveling pearls indicate the plant needs water. Water thoroughly and monitor the soil.
